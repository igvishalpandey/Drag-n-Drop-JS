# Drag and Drop Functionality

## Description
The Drag and Drop functionality is a web-based feature that allows users to drag elements from one container and drop them into another container. In this implementation, users can drag elements from a list of items and drop them into either a left or a right box.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Drag elements from one container (list) to another container (left or right box).
- Utilizes HTML Drag and Drop API for handling drag and drop events.
- Provides a visually interactive and intuitive user interface.

## JavaScript Learnings
The JavaScript code for this feature demonstrates several key concepts, including:
- **Event Handling**: Using event listeners to detect drag and drop events such as `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop`.
- **HTML Drag and Drop API**: Leveraging the built-in HTML Drag and Drop API to enable drag and drop functionality between containers.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the DOM to move elements between containers upon drop events.
